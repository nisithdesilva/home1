		<h2> Introduction </h2>
			<p class="box">Cryptozoology is the study of unknown animals about which little material evidence is available. 
			These animals are known as “cryptids”. Some cryptids, like the giant squid, or okapi are no longer urban legends, and are now proven to exist. 
			However, others, like the sasquatch, or the Loch Ness monster continue to boggle hopefuls and scientists with their possible existence. </p>
		<h2> Ex-Cryptids </h2>
		<h3> Giant Squid </h3>
			<img src="imgs/cryptid.jpg" alt="Giant Squid"/>
			<p class="box"> The Giant Squid is often cited as the inspiration for many classic mythological monsters and cryptids, including the Kraken and Scylla (from Greek mythology). 
			Reports of the Giant Squid go all the way back to Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder, and Aristotle. 
			Pliny actually underestimated the size of the giant squid, listing it at around 30 feet, but this was reasonable at the time given how little was known about the creature. 
			One reason why the squid may not have been discovered until now, is because of the insane magnitude of the ocean itself. 
			Plus, giant squids tend to lurk in the deeper parts of the ocean, where humans cannot often venture. 
			The first live specimen was recorded in 2006 when researchers tried to bait it to the surface off the Ogasawara Islands in Japan. </p>
		<h3> Okapi </h3>
			<img src="imgs/cryptid2.jpg" alt="Okapi"/>
			<p class="box"> Unlike the platypus, which will be mentioned later, or the giant squid, the environment of the Okapi was not isolated from the European scientific community. 
			European researchers and explorers already had a good understanding of its habitat in Central Africa, and had access to the area as well. 
			This is strange, because the Okapi was not officially recorded until 1901, but the main contact that explorers had with the animal was through hoofprints tracks. 
			However, this can be attributed to the fact that the Okapi resides in an extremely dense forest, where they are also typically quiet, solitary animals that don’t interact with visitors. 
			This would have made them much harder to single out than a pack animal in the grasslands for example. Either way, in 1901, with a lot of help from locals, zoologist and Imperial official Harry Johnston was finally able to get his hands on a skull and some skins to prove the Okapi’s existence. </p>
		<h3> Platypus </h3>
			<img src="imgs/cryptid3.jpg" alt="Platypus"/>
			<p class="box"> The platypus is a venomous, egg-laying, duck billed mammal, with the legs of an otter, and the tail of a beaver. 
			So, who in their right mind would think that a platypus isn’t some sort of practical joke that Australia happened to play on us? 
			Well, especially if you were a European naturalist from the 18th or 19th century, if you found a platypus skeleton, you’d probably just laugh and leave it before returning to your normal life. 
			Yeah, platypuses are weird. Even well-respected zoologist George Shaw thought the platypus might just be a crazy hoax when he wrote about it in the journal “Nature’s Miscellany” in 1799. 
			Well, obviously technology has progressed since then, and we have better ways of observing such animals, to see whether they really are living, breathing animals.  </p>
		<h2> Famous Cryptids </h2>
		<h3> Bigfoot/Sasquatch </h3>
			<img src="imgs/cryptid4.jpg" alt="Bigfoot"/>
			<p class="box"> Bigfoot is one of, if not the most famous cryptids in North America, and the world. 
			It is often described as a large, bipedal humanoid, covered in fur and standing up to 9 feet tall. 
			Majority of bigfoot sightings and “evidence” is pretty hazy, with only bad-quality photographs, and large footprints of unknown animals remaining. 
			Even with the lack of clear physical evidence, people still believe the massive creature exists and are still hunting it to this day. </p>
		<h3> Loch Ness Monster </h3>
			<img src="imgs/cryptid5.jpg" alt="Loch Ness Monster"/>
			<p class="box"> Now, here we get to the most famous cryptid in the world. 
			The Loch Ness monster, often affectionately called ‘Nessie’ supposedly resides in Loch Ness in Scotland. 
			It is described as a massive serpent that resides in the deep water of Loch Ness. 
			After Hugh Gray’s infamous photo was released to the world in 1933, the Loch Ness monster has been firmly implanted in popular culture. 
			Heck, even Google (Maps) made an easter egg, where when you visit Loch Ness on Google Maps, the person icon on your screen gains a Nessie costume. 
			This proves how far the legends have come, and that this particular cryptid is still somewhat relevant nowadays. </p>
		<h3> Chupacabra </h3>
			<img src="imgs/cryptid6.jpg" alt="Chupacabra"/>
			<p class="box"> The Chupacabra literally means ‘goat-sucker’, which is exactly what it supposedly does to livestock across Central and South America, and in particular, Puerto Rico. 
			The Chupacabra has been a staple in Puerto Rican folklore, and often an explanation for many mysterious livestock deaths, where they were found dead and drained of some blood. 
			The Chupacabra is described to be about the size of a small bear, with scaly skin, a tail, and a row of spines down its back. 
			Interestingly enough, hairless dogs are often mistaken for Chupacabras in Puerto Rico due to their sleek and dark appearance at night. </p>
		<h3> Yeti/Abominable Snowman </h3>
			<img src="imgs/cryptid7.jpg" alt="Yeti"/>
			<p class="box"> First, let’s get one thing straight: the Yeti and Bigfoot are different! 
			While Bigfoot is generally described to reside in North American Forests, The Yeti or Abominable Snowman is said to roam the Himalayas in Nepal, hence ‘snowman’ (because it’s cold up there). 
			Other than that though, the two entities are pretty similar in description, with the Yeti also being a large, hairy, bipedal humanoid, 
			and also having a lack of physical evidence other than some large (possibly fake) footprints. </p>
		<h3> Jersey Devil </h3>
			<img src="imgs/cryptid8.jpg" alt="Jersey Devil"/>
			<p class="box"> The Jersey Devil is one of the more unrealistic cryptids, being a mishmash of a variety of different animals. 
			While there is no definitive description yet, it is said to have a kangaroo-like body with the head of a goat, bat-like wings, horns, small arms with clawed hands, hooves on its hind legs, and a forked tail. 
			The creature has been sighted all over the New Jersey Pineland forest for more than 260 years, and is also known for its blood-curdling scream. </p>
