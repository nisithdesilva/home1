	<h2> Official Use and Conspiracies </h2>

		<p class="box"> Area 51 is officially called the Nevada Test and Training Range, and is a highly classified US Air Force facility located in Groom Lake, Nevada, about 150 miles from Las Vegas. 
		It is now used as an active training range for the US Air Force. 
		Now, that’s all well and good, but where are the ALIENS? Area 51 is a hot topic when it comes to aliens and alien bases on Earth. 
		Many people believe that there are aliens being stored and experimented on in Area 51. 
		This can’t even be properly refuted, because no one has actually been inside area 51, and found material evidence of these claims (will explain more later). 
		There have however, been countless photoshopped images, and fake news articles published on the topic, that has actually led to an increase in speculation on whether there truly are aliens or not. </p>

		<p class="box">In June, a student from Bakersfield, California made a joke post on Facebook titled: “Storm Area 51, They Can’t Stop All of Us”. 
		Little did he know, but this single post would explode, and the internet would get to work planning how to go about this event. 
		Loads of memes, articles, videos, and more memes ensued over the following months up until the fateful day: September 26, 2019. 
		At this point, the story was gaining national following due to the two million people that pledged to storm Area 51. 
		Now the outcome was obviously not as expected; you can’t just walk up to a military base and try and storm it. 
		A measly 200 people ended up showing up on September 26th, and some proceeded to try running past guards, only to get restrained, while others decided to simply stay back after being warned of the repercussions. 
		Now, in the end there was no raid, and there were no aliens, but was it a bust? Absolutely not. 
		This showed how the public can come together over one statement; and maybe we can apply this to our daily lives so we can better live in unity. </p>
